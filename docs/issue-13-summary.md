## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities (Addressing Issue Requirements)

### 1. Make workout generation 'actually work' with OpenAI APIs âœ…
**Current Status:** Framework exists but needs production readiness
**Action Items:**
- Secure API key management (environment variables or backend proxy)
- Enhanced prompt engineering for consistent, high-quality workouts
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Rate limiting and cost management
- User feedback loop for continuous improvement

### 2. Integration with Supabase for auth and data storage âœ…
**Current Status:** Using local storage only
**Action Items:**
- User authentication (email/password, social login)
- Cloud storage for user profiles, workouts, and progress
- Cross-device synchronization
- Data backup and recovery
- Migration from local UserDefaults to cloud database

### 3. Generate workouts in a trainer-compatible format âœ…
**Current Status:** Workouts only displayable in app
**Action Items:**
- .zwo file export (Zwift workout format)
- .erg file export (TrainerRoad/general trainer format)
- .mrc file export (generic trainer format)
- QR code sharing for quick workout import
- Direct integration APIs with popular platforms

### 4. Add a web version âœ…
**Current Status:** iOS only
**Action Items:**
- Responsive web application
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Coach/trainer dashboard features
- Shared authentication with mobile app
- Workout planning on larger screens

## ðŸš€ Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1 (3-4 months)
1. **Production AI Integration** - Make the core value proposition work reliably
2. **Supabase Authentication** - Enable user accounts and data persistence
3. **Workout Export** - Immediate value for existing cyclists with trainers

### Phase 2 (3-4 months)
4. **Web Platform** - Expand user base and enable coach features
5. **Hardware Integration** - Connect with cycling devices (Strava, power meters)
6. **Adaptive Training Plans** - AI-powered plan adjustments based on performance

## ðŸ’¡ Additional High-Value Features (Beyond Original Requirements)

### Smart Workout Scheduling
- Weather-aware indoor/outdoor recommendations

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics to Track

- **AI Generation Success Rate**: >95% successful workout generations
- **User Retention**: 30-day retention >60%
- **Export Usage**: >40% of generated workouts exported to trainers
- **Cross-Platform Adoption**: Web users complement mobile users

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. Prioritize and scope Phase 1 features
2. Set up Supabase project and authentication
3. Implement secure OpenAI API integration
4. Design workout export file formats
5. Plan web application architecture
