# AI-Powered Cycling Training Plan Generator

## Overview
This feature will allow users to generate a personalized cycling workout using AI. The system will take the user's Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and selected workout type to create a structured single workout with appropriate intensities and durations tailored to the user's capabilities.

## User Journey
1. User navigates to workout generator screen
2. User selects desired workout type (endurance, threshold, VO2 max, etc.)
3. System retrieves user's FTP from profile data
4. System generates single workout using AI
5. User reviews generated workout using existing workout detail view
6. User accepts or regenerates the workout
7. Accepted workout is added to the top of the user's weekly schedule

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Workout Type Selection
**Description:** Allow users to select the type of workout they want to generate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Present users with clearly labeled workout type options (Endurance, Threshold, VO2 Max, Sprint, Recovery)
- Each option includes a brief description of the workout type and its benefits
- Selection should be visually clear and accessible
- Allow users to change their selection before generating the workout

### FR2: FTP Integration
**Description:** Use the user's stored FTP value to calculate appropriate power targets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System retrieves FTP value from user profile (assume this is always available)
- FTP value is used to calculate power zones for the generated workout
- Power values in workout are displayed as both absolute watts and percentage of FTP

### FR3: AI Workout Generation
**Description:** Generate a structured workout using OpenAI APIs based on user input.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generated workout includes distinct phases: warm-up, main set, and cool down
- Each interval includes duration and target power
- Workout difficulty matches selected workout type
- Total workout duration is reasonable (30-90 minutes)
- AI prompt engineering ensures consistent output format
- Provide error handling if AI generation fails
- Display loading indicator during generation process

### FR4: Workout Review and Acceptance
**Description:** Allow users to review the generated workout using the existing workout detail view.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display the workout in the existing workout detail view
- Allow user to regenerate if they're not satisfied with the result
- Provide clear accept/reject buttons
- When accepted, add the workout to the top of the weekly schedule
- Show confirmation when workout is added to schedule

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Workout generation should complete within 5 seconds
- UI should remain responsive during API calls

### NFR2: Usability
- Interface should be intuitive and require minimal explanation
- Integration with existing workout detail view should be seamless
- Text and interactive elements should follow accessibility guidelines

### NFR3: Security
- OpenAI API key should be properly secured
- User's FTP and other personal data should be handled securely

## Technical Considerations
- OpenAI API integration will require proper error handling and fallback options
- Local caching of generated workouts to reduce API calls
- Consider implementing a rate limiter to prevent excessive API usage
- Ensure generated workout data structure is compatible with existing workout detail view
