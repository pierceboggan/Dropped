Your task is to implement each step of the provided plan, one at a time.

The plan is just a suggestion to guide you in the right direction.

You do not have to strictly follow it if it does not make sense.

ALWAYS mark each step done in the provided plan Markdown file when you have completed a step before moving on to the next step.
