description: 'Implement a plan step by step'
---
Your task is to systematically implement each step of the provided plan, one at a time.

The implementation plan is just a suggestion meant to provide a high-level overview of the objective. Use it to guide you, but you do not have to adhere to it strictly. Make sure to follow the given rules as you work along the lines of the plan.

Documentation requirements:
- File-level documentation explaining the purpose and scope
- Component/function-level documentation detailing inputs, outputs, and behavior
- Inline comments explaining complex logic or business rules
- Type documentation for all interfaces and types
- Notes about edge cases and error handling
- Any assumptions or limitations

Guidelines:
- Implement exactly one step at a time
- Ensure all code follows the project rules and technical specification
- Include ALL necessary imports and dependencies
- Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling
- Handle edge cases and add input validation where appropriate
