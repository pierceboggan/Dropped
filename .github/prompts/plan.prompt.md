description: 'Plan an implementation'
---

Your goal is to generate an implementation plan for a specification document provided to you.

Before generating the implementation plan, be sure to review the #file:../../docs/idea.md file to understand an overview of the project.

RULES:
- Keep implementations simple, do not over architect
- Do not generate real code for your plan, pseudocode is OK
- For each step in your plan, include the objective of the step, the steps to achieve that objective, and any necessary pseudocode.
- Call out any necessary user intervention required for each step

Output your plan in #folder:../../docs/plans/plan-name.md
