CODE RULES:

- UI should feel consistent across app. For example, if going from one screen to the next in navigation, the visual elements should look like they belong together
- Generate accessible UI
- When creating new components, always place them at the bottom of the file (not in a SwiftUI code block)
- Do not use Swift previews in the code, they are not supported in this environment

DOCS RULES:

- Include documentation within the Swift files
- File-level documentation explaining the purpose and scope
- Component/function-level documentation detailing inputs, outputs, and behavior
- Inline comments explaining complex logic or business rules
- Type documentation for all interfaces and types
- Notes about edge cases and error handling
- Any assumptions or limitations
